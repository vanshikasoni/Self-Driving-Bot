# Self-Driving-Indoor-Navigation-Bot Using Deep-Learning

### In this project:

## P1: Dataset Creation Summary: Controlling Bot using PID controller for keeping the car on track by appropriately adjusting the steering angle. and capturing frames of live streaming video of the lane at the speed of 40fps. detecting edges and angle of deviation using OpenCV. Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, PID Controller

## P2 - Bot training to detect lane edge, adjust steering angle. Built and trained a combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural networks. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and image argumentation. Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, Deep Neural Network

## P3. Model deployment and testing. End-to-end pipelines creation for the deployment as well as for retraining the model, deployed on Raspberry pie board and Nvidia Jetson Nano board.
